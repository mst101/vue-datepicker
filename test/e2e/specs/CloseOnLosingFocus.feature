Feature: Close on losing focus
  As a user
  I want to make the calendar lose focus
  So that I can close it


  @id-1
  Scenario Outline: Click outside: <openOrClosed>
    Given the calendar is "<openOrClosed>"
    And the input field is focused
    When the user clicks the body
    Then the calendar "<opensOrCloses>"
    And no element has focus

    Examples:
      | # | openOrClosed | opensOrCloses |
      | 1 | closed       | closes        |
      | 2 | open         | closes        |


  @id-2
  Scenario Outline: Click outside: typeable, <openOrClosed>, <validity>
    Given the typeable calendar is "<openOrClosed>" and a "<validity>" date is typed
    And the input field is focused
    When the user clicks the body
    Then the calendar "<opensOrCloses>"
    And the date is "<formattedOrCleared>"
    And no element has focus

    Examples:
      | # | openOrClosed | validity | opensOrCloses | formattedOrCleared |
      | 1 | closed       | valid    | closes        | formatted          |
      | 2 | closed       | invalid  | closes        | cleared            |
      | 3 | open         | valid    | closes        | formatted          |
      | 4 | open         | invalid  | closes        | cleared            |


  @id-3
  Scenario: Reopen after click outside when `show-calendar-on-focus` is true: <openOrClosed>
    Given `show-calendar-on-focus` is true and the calendar is open
    When the user clicks the body
    Then the calendar closes
    And no element has focus
    When the input field is focused
    Then the calendar opens
